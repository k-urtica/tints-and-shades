# Tints and Shades Generator Tool Guide

## What is Tints and Shades Generator?

**Tints and Shades Generator** is a web tool that automatically generates beautiful color variations from a single base color.

**Tints** refer to lighter colors created by mixing the original color with white. **Shades** refer to darker colors created by mixing the original color with black.

With this tool, designers and developers no longer need to manually adjust colors one by one. You can instantly create unified and beautiful color palettes. It's a practical tool that can be used in various scenarios such as web design, UI design, and brand color development.

## Why was this tool created?

Have you ever thought while designing, "This color is nice, but I'd like a slightly lighter version" or "I want to create a darker version too"?

**Tints and Shades Generator** was born from such common design challenges. Creating natural and beautiful gradients instantly from a single color - that's the reason this tool exists.

## When to use it?

### When creating websites or apps

"I've decided on the main color, but thinking about hover colors for buttons, background colors, text colors... it's overwhelming"
â†’ Get a complete set of unified colors from just one color

### When using TailwindCSS

"I want to define custom colors, but thinking about all scales from 50 to 950?"
â†’ The "âœ¨Tailwind" tab creates ready-to-use color scales instantly

### When deciding brand colors

"I've decided on the logo color, but I need color variations for the entire site"
â†’ Get rich color options while maintaining brand color consistency

## How to use (Let's try it out)

### Step 1: Choose a color

- Enter `#3b82f6` in the color input field at the top left (this is blue)
- Or click the color picker (small square button) next to it to choose any color you like
- â€»Currently only supports HEX format (6-digit color codes starting with #)

### Step 2: Adjust intensity

- Move the "Weight" slider on the right side
- Smaller numbers create gradual changes, larger numbers create bold changes
- The default setting of "5" works well, but adjust to your preference

### Step 3: View and copy results

A color palette will be displayed in the center of the screen:

- **Light colors (Tints)**: Like mixing white with the original color
- **Original color (Base)**: The exact color you entered (with alert icon)
- **Dark colors (Shades)**: Like mixing black with the original color

Click on any color you like to copy its code. You should see "Copied!" appear in the top right.

### Step 4: Adjust display (optional)

In the settings on the right, you can:

- **Theme switching**: Check colors in dark mode too
- **Display options**: Add borders or hide codes
- **Step size**: Fine-tune adjustments down to 0.1% increments

## Using different tabs

- **All**: See all colors (this is the default)
- **Tints**: When you only want to see light colors
- **Shades**: When you only want to see dark colors
- **âœ¨Tailwind**: TailwindCSS color scale format (50-950)

## Useful tips

**When unsure about color selection**: Click the ðŸ”„ button at the top left for random colors. You might discover something unexpected.

**For fine adjustments**: Set the "Step size" below Weight settings to 0.1 for extremely precise control.

**To improve workflow efficiency**: Bookmark URLs with colors you use frequently. Colors are saved with the `?color=` parameter.
